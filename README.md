My first portfolio website. I challenged myself to make a website that showed off my CS capabilities with frontend tools I was least familiar with, which, at the time, was the React framework. The site itself is a bit like a three legged dog; it'll run, but its not very stable. I learned much about frontend design while putting together this showcase; it also helped me isolate and correct the very many bad habits and weak areas in my competencies as a programmer. Unfortunately, I was unhappy with how it turned out. I thought it looked a bit cheesy, and it had far too many bugs, so I decided to relagate it here to archive purgatory.
